First, install Node.js. Then, install the latest Cordova and Ionic command-line tools in your terminal. Follow the Android and iOS platform guides to install required tools for development.

### Install Ionic

```
npm install -g cordova ionic

```

### Start an App

```
ionic start myApp tabs

```

### Run your App

```

cd myApp
ionic serve

```

Much of your app can be built right in the browser with ```ionic serve```. We recommend starting with this workflow.

When you're ready to deploy your app to a real device, check out our [Deploying guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/deploying).
